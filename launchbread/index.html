<p><font color="red">[November, 2010]</font> Initial write-up.</p>
<p><font color="red">[April, 2015]</font> This page was created in 2010. Many things have changed. The procedures to setup a working environment is outdate and there are ways that is simpler and easier to setup the LP development environment under Linux.</p>

<h3>Description</h3><br>
<p>This is a tryout project based on the ti MSP430G2211. The project objective is to gain understanding on the basic io of this new mcu, tries out the toolchain under linux, etc.</p>
<p>The launchpad i got looks like this.</p>
<br><img src="images/launchbread.jpg"><br><br>
<br><br>
<p>Ti launchpad info link <a href="http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/MSP430_LaunchPad_%28MSP-EXP430G2%29?DCMP=launchpad&HQS=Other+OT+launchpadwiki">here</a></p>
<p>I acquired a ti lauchpad one week after it was launched. Since i work solely on a linux environment, it is natural to try and make it work under linix. <s>Unfortunately the launchpad has a different UIF firmware and mspdebug has not yet to support it</s> (as of july 7th). After combing through the datasheets it appears the mcu is very close to the F2013, in that they appears to share the same memory map and register layouts.</p>
<p>After visiting the losinggeneration site and trying, i realized that the launchpad had been working right out of the box with mspdebug all along, i was not able to get it working was due to usb driver problems. Still after connecting the launchpad, i can only run one mspdebug session. If i want to connect again i need to detach / re-attach launchpad. But the flash uploading, debugging via sbw all works fine now.</p>
<p>So i did the natural thing and create this "launchbread" (like breadboard arduino / breaduino) and use the ez430 usb dongle for programming and debuging.</p>
<p>In this setup i assembly the project w/ the extra G2211 mcu from the launchpad kit, i tried the G2231 and it works as well.</p>
<p>The ez430 doggle i got has the 4-pin 0.05in pitch connector and from studying the schematics we have;</p>
<ul>
<li>pin1 as VCC, (header P1)</li>
<li>pin2 as SBWCLK, (header P11)</li>
<li>pin3 as SBWTDIO, (header P10) RST</li>
<li>pin4 as GND, (header P14)</li>
</ul>
</>
</>
<p>We can directly hook this up on a breadboard setting. As the 0.05in pitched headers are hard to find, i sacrificed daughter F2012 board (3 for $10, i prey away the mcu and added 0.1in headers) so that i can have a solid 0.1in header connection. The provided header on the F2012 board has pin layout exactly as the targe G2xx device</p>
<p>The following shows an original F2012 daughter board and the one that had the MCU ripped off with 2x7 male header installed.</p>

<br><br>
<p>The whole hookup look like this with the EZ430-FET and jumper wires;</p>

<h3>Toolchain setup</h3><br>
<p>My environment is ubuntu 10.04 lucid. We will need msp430-gcc4 and mspdebug. There is already a tutorial covering this which i had followed and worked well. <s>The mylightswitch.com tutorial can be found here</s></p>
<h3>Mspdebug Session</h3><br>
<p>With the header / jumpers ready, i fired up mspdebug and got the followng;</p>

<p>so afterall it is recognized as a MSP430F20x1 device. but does it programs? i then wrote a simple sketch (source code below) to try out basic ios and the timer. programming worked fine, step worked, run worked.</p>

<h3>RGB LED Source</h3><br>
<ul>
<li>Use Timer to implement software pwm @ 25% duty (save resistors)</li>
<li>Layout button and led so that i don't need jumpers (save jumpers)</li>
<li>Press button to cycle thru the rgb combinations (8 of them)</li>
<li>compensate individual color led brightness by turning them off at different rates (doesn't seem to work)</li>
</ul>
